To compute the triangulation package, do:

Triangulation tri = new Triangulation(...);
tri.compute();

Segments and triangles are here:
tri.getSegments();
tri.getTriangles();

To represent the input data, there are two possibilities:

- use the TriangulationPointImpl, TriangulationSegmentImpl and
TriangulationTriangleImpl classes implemented in the 'impl' package.

- if you already have your point, segment and triangle classes and want to use the
triangulation on them, make them implement respectivelly the TriangulationPoint,
TriangulationSegment and TriangulationTriangle interfaces.
You also need 2 factories implemeting respectivelly the TriangulationSegmentFactory
and TriangulationTriangleFactory interfaces.
