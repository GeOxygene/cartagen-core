# Tutorial on on the advanced use of the AGENT model with CartAGen
This tutorial explains how to use the [AGENT][2] agent-based generalization model implemented in CartAGen. Be aware that this implementation is for now mainly based on research code that has not been consolidated. Many bugs still remain and some functionalities described in the papers describing the model are not implemented in CartAGen.
