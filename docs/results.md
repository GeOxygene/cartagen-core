Results from [Marion Dumont's PhD][2]
-------------
The results presented in this section are multi-scale maps with three intermediate scales between 1:25k and 1:100k (both scales are existing maps). The Gif animations zoom in and out from the 1:25k to the 1:100k, through the three intermediate scales obtained by automatic generalization.

Multi-scale map obtained with a combination of AGENT and CartACom.
