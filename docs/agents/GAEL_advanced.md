# Tutorial to the advanced use of the GAEL model
This tutorial explains how to use the GAEL model in a more advanced way than in the [agent-based generalization tutorial][2]. Be aware that each of these implementations are for now mainly based on research code that has not been consolidated. Many bugs still remain and some functionalities described in the papers describing the models are not implemented in CartAGen.
