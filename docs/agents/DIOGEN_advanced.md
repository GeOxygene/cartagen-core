# Tutorial to the advanced use of the DIOGEN model
This tutorial explains how to use the DIOGEN model in a more advanced way than in the [agent-based generalization tutorial][2]. Be aware that this implementation is for now mainly based on research code that has not been consolidated. Many bugs still remain and some functionalities described in the papers describing the model are not implemented in CartAGen.
