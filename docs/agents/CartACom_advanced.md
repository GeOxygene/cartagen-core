# Tutorial to the advanced use of the CartACom model
This tutorial explains how to use the CartACom model in a more advanced way than in the [agent-based generalization tutorial][2]. It describes the available spatial relation, relational constraints, and actions in the current implementation, how to change the relations/constraints/actions used by the model, and how to add new relations/contstraints/actions by code. Finally, this tutorial explains how to customize the advanced features of CartACom (life cycle, conversations, ...).
