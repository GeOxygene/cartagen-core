Description of the algorithm
-------------
This algorithm aggregates two close buildings by determining the joining polygon that makes the most compact shape.

The image below shows how edges of each polygon are extended to straight lines and the intersections between these straight lines are used to create different possible aggregated polygons. In the case below, the polygon b) is preferred by the algorithm.

When to use the algorithm?
-------------

This algorithm was initially developed for the aggregation of two close buildings. It can be extended to other man-made polygon features, what C. DuchÃªne calls *small compact features*, *e.g.* sports fields, greenhouses or similar map features.
