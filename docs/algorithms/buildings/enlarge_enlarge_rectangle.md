Description of the algorithms
-------------
Both algorithms enlarge buildings that are too small for being legible at a given scale. The enlarge algorithm simply transforms the initial geometry with a homothety to target area. The enlarge to rectangle algorithm replaces the polygon by its smallest surrounding rectangle and then adjusts the size of the rectangle with a homothety transformation.

Both algorithms have the same parameter described in the table below.

| Parameter name        | Description         				| Type 							| Default value			|
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| goalArea    | the area the enlarged building should have after generalization	| double mÂ²			| 								|

When to use the algorithm?
-------------
With simple geometries, the enlarge to rectangle algorithm should be preferred as it also solves potential granularity issues and there is no need to trigger an additional simplification algorithm.
