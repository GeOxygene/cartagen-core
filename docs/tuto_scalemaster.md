The Basic Concepts of the ScaleMaster framework
-------------
The ScaleMaster framework was first proposed by [Brewer & Buttenfield (2007)][3]
To be done...
Further experiments on multi-scale maps design with the ScaleMaster were presented by [Brewer & Buttenfield (2009)][4].

The ScaleMaster2.0
-------------
The ScaleMaster2.0 is updated version of the ScaleMaster dedicated to automated generalization based on the rules of a ScaleMaster. It was proposed by [Touya & Girres (2013)][2]
